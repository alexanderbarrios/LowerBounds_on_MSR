# Code for Lower Bounds for the Modified Szpiro Ratio
This repository contains the code that verifies some of the results of the paper *Lower Bounds for the Modified Szpiro Ratio* by Alexander Barrios.


This code was written on SageMath and Mathematica, and the repository consists of  files:

(1) definitions.sage
(2) Verifications.ipynb
(3) Lemma3_2.nb
(4) Lemma3_2.pdf
(5) Theorem4_3.nb
(6) Theorem4_3.pdf
(7) Theorem4_3.ipynb

File (1) contains the definitions that are called by (2) and (5)
File (2) verifies that \alpha_T, \beta_T, \gamma_T, \delta_T, and \delta_{T,u_T} are as claimed in the paper. The file also verifies Lemma 3.1.
File (3) and (4) verify Lemma 3.2. We note that (4) is a pdf of the mathematica notebook (3).
File (3) and (4) verify Lemma 3.2. We note that (4) is a pdf of the mathematica notebook (3).
File (5) and (6) verify that max{|c_{4,T}|^3,c_{6,T}^2} is as claimed in Theorem 4.3. We note that (6) is a pdf of the mathematica notebook (5).
File (7) verifies that the limit of the modified Szpiro ratio of F_T(t) goes to l_T as |t|-> infinity.
